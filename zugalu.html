		  		<span class="black headline">Designing the Thrive UI</span>

				  <p>With such a vast amount of information in need of presentation for players, the design and interaction of the UI was critical for the player to make sense of the Thrive interface. There were some narrow design constraints that limited what was possible to produce in time for release, which forced some creative thinking on what we could manage. In the end, I avoided fancy animations and overly elaborate content to focus on readability and presentation.</p>	
				  <p>Ultrawide displays are favored by over 40% of our target audience. As a result, we took great pains to ensure that each in-game screen conformed to both standard and ultrawide displays without losing visual fidelity or forcing extra steps to view content.</p>		

				  <span class="sectionheader">The Four Panel HUD</span>		  
  				<img style="border:1px solid #fff;min-width:420px;max-width:100%;margin-bottom:1em;" alt="'Thrive : Heavy Lies the Crown' - City Builder/RTS (Zugalu Entertainment)" src="images/zugalu/interface.png"/>	 				  
					<img style="border:1px solid #fff;min-width:420px;max-width:100%;margin-bottom:1em;" alt="'Thrive : Heavy Lies the Crown' - City Builder/RTS (Zugalu Entertainment)" src="images/zugalu/interface2.png"/>	
					<center><p class="subheader">The in-game hud, and a breakdown of the panel setup.</p></center>

					<p>The interface had to convey a lot of data at any given time : resource chains are integral to the game design. I opted to divide the display into four Panels to maximize display space without overburdening the user with information:</p>   		
  				<ul class="experience">
  					<li>&#8226; <span class="bold purple">Stats Panel</span> : Anything that isn't specifically part of a structure is handled on this side of the interface. This includes Trade, Edicts, Diplomacy, Research, Jobs, Stats and Events.</li>							
  					<li>&#8226; <span class="bold purple">HUD</span> : Conveys real-time numerical feedback on resource totals, happiness, wealth, time, date, and any other relevant information. It also covers the 'Waelgrim' bar, and the specific interface buttons for the Stats Panel and Info Panel.</li>
  					<li>&#8226; <span class="bold purple">Info Panel</span> : This panel conveys information on structures the player interacts with. This is where they can gather any relevant information they need on production, resource gathering, population happiness and other important metrics.</li>
  					<li>&#8226; <span class="bold purple">Build Bar</span> : This panel covers all elements related to placing or removing structures. It is also where military unit information is displayed when interacting with combat units.</li>
  				</ul>		

  				<span class="sectionheader">Tooltips</span>
  				<p>I opted to focus primarily on tooltips as a means to display critical data to the player: as UI elements they are small, easily adjusted, and can be universally applied across the entire design (thus helping to cut costs with unnecessary additional interfaces.)</p>	
					
					<img alt="An example of a tooltip." src="images/zugalu/tooltip1.png" style="float:left;"/>
					<img alt="An example of a tooltip." src="images/zugalu/tooltip3.png"/><br style="clear:both;"/>
					<center><p class="subheader">Examples of tooltips provided in-game.</p></center>

          <span class="sectionheader">Icon Design</span>
  				<p>Thrive needed a huge array of icons to convey information to players. We had too few artists to manage this, so I took on the task myself. Thematically, all icons were monochrome and were functional in the first iteration but in the end I opted to rework them in color via hand-painting. This took a great deal of extra time, but the end results were superior by every measure.</p>
  				<p>To save memory we placed icons in sprite atlases. Then, we created a script to generate these icons into RichText, which in turn was fed into our TechMesh elements. The end result : icons we could add to text blurbs using simple inline HTML.</p>
 				  <img alt="Resource icon examples." src="images/zugalu/icons1a.png"/>
					<center><p class="subheader">Examples of some Resource icons.</p></center>

  				<span class="sectionheader">Alerts</span>
  				<p>Fire, disease, health, construction and other states all needed displays the player could make sense of at a glance, reducing the amount of micromanagement necessary at any given moment. When the state of a unit or structure changes, they display the needed information and, if necessary, also provide a tooltip with additional data should the player desire it.</p>	
					
					<img alt="An example of a fire alert." src="images/zugalu/firealert.png" style="width:100%;"/>
					<center><p class="subheader">Fires, Construction, Deconstruction and Health all display above their respective structures when relevant.</p></center>
					<img alt="Unit HP bars." src="images/zugalu/unithp.png" style="width:100%;"/>
					<center><p class="subheader">Units for healthbars are minimal in the gameplay space so players can focus on combat.</p></center>

					<span class="sectionheader">First-Time User Experience Design</span>
					<p>Tutorials are a complicated balancing act: give too little information and players will struggle to make sense of your mechanics. Give too <i>much</i> and they get annoyed and want to quit. For Thrive, I chose to guide the player through their first hour or two of gameplay by directly teaching each core mechanic, but allowing them to work out the finer points on their own time.</p>

  				<img alt="An FTUE text panel." src="images/zugalu/ftue.png" style="width:100%;"/>
					<center><p class="subheader">An FTUE panel, complete with hoverable building images with tooltips, and inline RichText icons.</p></center>		

					<p>Next I designed a 'Help' system that functioned similarly to an encyclopedia in the Civilization games: At any moment the player can open the panels and get information on the currently selected structure, unit or interface. Players who opted to skip the tutorial, therefore, still had access to the same information if it was required.</p>
  				<img alt="A help panel." src="images/zugalu/helppanelsample.png"/> 				
					<center><p class="subheader">The 'Help' panel pullout. It contains textual information on all gameplay topics, with collapsible sections for easy reading.</p></center>	

  				<img alt="An onscreen objective display." src="images/zugalu/tuto2.png" style="width:100%;"/>
					<center><p class="subheader">Onscreen objective display for Tutorials.</p></center>

          <span class="sectionheader">Player Agency and Meaningful Choices</span>
          <p>Choice was a key pillar of Thrive; Every 2 to 3 days of gametime, narrative choices are presented by the government advisors who manage the players kingdom. The selections a player makes from these conversations affects the narrative of the game and drives progression. By Tier 3 of play, these options align the player with Tyrannical or Benevolent rule. This gives access to different military units, building types and citizen classes, as well as the style of gameplay.</p>
  				<img alt="The Narrative Event icon." src="images/zugalu/hudindicator.png" style="width:100%;"/>
					<center><p class="subheader">When an event is ready, a player is prompted with an onscreen alert within the HUD.</p></center>	

          <p>Early on, a design choice was made to not show players the result of these options; We wanted to keep replayability by not gamifying selections. A player is less likely to choose a 'bad' or 'good' option this way and instead make the judgement based solely on the moral compass they elect to follow.</p>
  				<img alt="An event text panel." src="images/zugalu/event1.png" style="width:100%;"/>
					<center><p class="subheader">Advisors speak with players every 2 to 3 game days.</p></center>	

  				<img alt="An FTUE text panel." src="images/zugalu/choice.png" style="width:100%;"/>
					<center><p class="subheader">Choices are all weighted, giving points for Benevolent or Tyrannical leadership that ultimately lead to a particular style of rule (and the units available to that ethos.) The player is never informed of the points they gain to prevent gamification of choices.</p></center>	

  				<img alt="An example of a tooltip." alt="A players reward for their choice." src="images/zugalu/reward.png" style="width:100%;"/>
					<center><p class="subheader">Every choice has some form of meaningful outcome. This can vary from resources, to citizens, to unlocked technology.</p></center>	

					<span class="sectionheader">The Tome of Knowledge</span>
					<p>In addition to Narrative choices, there is another area of choice provided to players that can significantly change how the game operates: the Tome of Knowledge. This functions as the 'research' system in Thrive. The choices a player makes here provide immediate adjustments to specific structures, classes of citizen, military units or trade.</p>
					<p>These choices can be made only once specific prerequisites are met, and are permanently applied to their kingdom. In addition, players unlock 'Masteries' through their narrative choices with their advisors, which can provide significant game-changing specializations to their empire.</p>
  				<img alt="The Tome of Knowledge." src="images/zugalu/research.png" style="width:100%;"/>
					<center><p class="subheader">Every choice has some form of meaningful outcome. This can vary from resources, to citizens, to unlocked technology.</p></center>

					<center><p class="subheader">The two different options available from the Food Stores item on the Tome of Knowledge.</p></center>	

					<span class="sectionheader">The World Map</span>
					<p>We wanted to provide a map to players, but not one that was rendered in 3d, as we felt this was too modern of an approach (and would potentially be non-performant.) Instead, we went with a hand-drawn look to provide a somewhat old-timey feel, but with modern styled tooltips, unit markers and other assets. To access it, the player merely uses the mouse-wheel to zoom in and out. When they reach a certain threshold, the map will load in rather than the gameplay area.</p>
  				<img alt="The in-game map, rendered in real-time." src="images/zugalu/map2.png" style="width:100%;"/>
					<center><p class="subheader">The map displays real-time unit positions, military fortifications, provinces, trade units and other details.</p></center>

					<span class="sectionheader">Production Statistics</span>
					<p>Another key feature required in the UI was real-time tracking of production, allowing users to keep an eye on production output, input, supply lines and their generated wealth (among other things.) With deterministic Lockstep handling the backend, it was relatively simple to provide this, though the graphic feature took a great amount of time to produce.</p>
  				<img alt="The in-game map, rendered in real-time." src="images/zugalu/stats.png" style="width:100%;"/>
					<center><p class="subheader">The Statistics panel provides all the real-time tracking a player could need.</p></center>
					<img alt="Cash management." src="images/zugalu/stats2.png" style="width:100%;"/>
					<center><p class="subheader">Wealth can be tracked down to the last detail, complete with collapsible menus and real-time updates.</p></center>

					<span class="sectionheader">Multiplayer Combat and Trade</span>
					<p>Finally, the product could not ship without multiplayer. We wanted an Age of Empires meets Anno feel, and this required careful balance of resource costs and military production rates in addition to properly developing military stats for each unit so the Neutral, Benevolent and Tyrannical were not better than their opponents. In addition, we needed to determine game types, design for victory conditions, add Steam support, and provide the expected suite of features typical of multiplayer (chat, lobby, invites, etc.)</p>
					<img alt="Multiplayer victory." src="images/zugalu/victoryscreen.png" style="width:100%;"/>
