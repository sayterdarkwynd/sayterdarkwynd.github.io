  <h1>Latest Update 0.394</h1>

    <div class="itemcontent">

      <p>In a nutshell: One of the most ambistious mods for a game called Starbound.</p>
      <p>Formerly "Frackin' Flora", it has been re-branded as Frackin'Universe because the scope is so much larger than I'd initially intended. It is a "catch-all" mod that enhances almost every major area of starbound play in some fashion.</p>
      <p>The primary focus is gene-engineering your own plants, each with their own qualities and uses to make play more interesting. It comes with a large variety of new biomes, sub-biomes, underground biomes, and underground sub-biomes (and new planet core types!) that provide ample exploration opportunities. Some resources can be found only on particular types of worlds and no others so you'll need to be savvy if you want the best lab you can muster.</p>
