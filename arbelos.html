			  <p>Through this program Students and Educators meet online and engage in schooling tailored for STEM topics. In addition to education, students are able to interfact with the game world around them in meaningful ways. Level designs in Stemuli were treated as sandboxes that allow students to wander, interact and roleplay with one another. Rather than focusing on conventional challenges like platforming or combat students instead are presented with an array of minigames to fullfill educational objectives while presenting them with learning opportunities in the form of tests, teamwork-based excercises, and creativity-rich assignments that challenge and compel.<p>
