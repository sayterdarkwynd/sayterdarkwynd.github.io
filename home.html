        <div class="textbox">

          <p class="whitetext">FrackinUniverse is not a small mod by any means. It is closer to a Total Conversion and extends gameplay in Starbound by approximately 50-200 hours. Expect a learning curve. The following is a general list of features and there is more to offer than listed.</p>

<p class="type legendary">Core Gameplay Changes & Additions</p>
	  <div class="info">
		  <ul class="features">

		    <li>+ Based loosely on real-world science, many resources can be found just as you'd expect in the real world. Extract hydrogen and oxygen from water, use saltpeter to create explosives or condense carbon into diamond</li>
		    <li>+ <strong class="raretext">A re-paced early game</strong>: Early game options are extended substantially, allowing players to specialize their development into various areas. Enhance your early game progression with expanded farming and wood-based crafting options, new ways to feed and raise your farm animals, easier collection of water and so much more!</li>
			<li>+ Well <strong class="raretext">over 100 new status effects</strong> that provide buffs, debuffs and countless other effects on your character</li>
			<li>+ <strong class="raretext">Liquid Interactions</strong>: Change the composition of tiles or even other liquids using liquid. Turn a dirt hovel into a slimey cave or turn harmless metal into deadly, super-heated steel.<li>
			<li>+ <strong class="raretext">Tile Effects</strong>: Various terrain types will affect your travels. Ice will make you slip, snow will slow you down and mud will stick you good. Some materials even provide beneficial effects. Cover your bases ground in asphalt and run like the wind!</li>
			<li>+ <strong class="raretext">EPP revamp</strong>: Rather than each EPP upgrade protecting against all previous effects, each now protects *only* against its particular type of effect. There are literally dozens of other ways to protect yourself from them in FU.</li>
		    <li>+ <strong class="raretext">over 100 new tile types</strong></li>
		    <li>+ <strong class="raretext">Fear the Dark</strong>: Without a light-source, exploration is extremely unwise</li>
		    <li>+ <strong class="raretext">over 20 new liquids</strong> such as Liquid Nitrogen, Sulphuric Acid, Beer, Honey and Aether</li>
		  </ul>
	  </div>

<p class="type legendary">Mech Changes</p>
	  <div class="info">
		  <ul class="features">
		    <li>+ <strong class="raretext">Mass</strong>: Mech parts now have mass. Mass has numerous effects on your mech.

Low-Mass mechs move swifter, jump farther, have more energy and passive repair when stationary and above 50% energy.</li>
			<li>+ <strong class="raretext">New Mech Parts</strong>: More weapon types available as options for your mech! Use point-defense, powerful beams, various projectile weapons and more!</li>
		    <li>+ Mechs have Augments you can place in the Horn slot. Currently two types exist: Aim Actuator and Mass Reducer augments.</li>
		    <li>+ Mech combat damage revamped, along with Space monsters. They no longer use their own damage and defense tables, instead relying on modified values to balance them for planet and space use.</li>
		  </ul>

        <h1 class="positive large">Included Mods (do not download separately)</h1>
        <img src="images/biome.png" />
        <div class="textbox">
          <blockquote>* fixed critter spawns so that they appear where they should, rather than wherever they feel like it. No more subterranean ducks, horses, etc!<br/><br/>

* did the same to various monster spawns that acted the same way. Raptors are the most notable among them.<br/><br/>

* added some FU goods to vanilla merchant lists, as well as canned food<br/><br/>

* Terraforming preparation: added biomePlaced tag to most FU biome objects so that they can spawn with terraformers when FU biomes are implemented into that system<br/><br/>

* Napalm Launcher recipe corrected to use tier 4/5 materials<br/><br/>

* Wild Mooshi, Fluffalo, etc can all be captured now. When released, however, they will be babies of the non-wild variety.<br/><br/>

* Wild Mooshis, Fluffalos, Hens and Robot Hens have heavily reduced HP. There was no need for the wild variants to have 250 health.<br/><br/>

* replaced the Trianglium Ore patch file with a straight override, since as far as I know nothing else uses Trianglium in the mod community, and it remains unused in vanilla. This is done in preparation for a removal of this ore, since CF seems to be on a roll removing long-unused assets. I will re-patch it if this seems to no longer be a worry.<br/><br/>

* as above, but with Lead and Sulphur<br/><br/>

* You can now craft your own robotic guardians! start by finding some parts from a dead Servitor bot to unlock their recipe. The other recipes must be found. You can craft the bots themselves at your Nanofabricator for the time being (in the same tab the mining guns are under, with the little microchip icon)<br/><br/>

* Battery recipe swapped to use Lead instead of Wire (MA version, not vanilla battery)<br/><br/>

* Microformers for FU subbiomes added, and appended to the loot-list which generates these objects. So, you should be finding them along with the vanilla ones from the new dungeon monsters<br/><br/>

* Refinery values of many resources increased. Thanks to UltraHex for this contribution.<br/><br/>

* adjusted several armor suit appearances (thanks to the illustrious DarkPursuer)</blockquote>
